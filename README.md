### Files and Directories

- **app.py**: The main Flask application to serve the web interface and interact with the machine learning model.
- **date-wise-retail-selling-price-of-petrol-and-diesel-in-metro-cities.xlsx**: The dataset containing historical prices of petrol and diesel in various metro cities.
- **final model.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook used for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- **model.pkl**: The serialized machine learning model used for making predictions.
- **static/**: Directory containing static files like JavaScript and CSS.
  - **script.js**: JavaScript file for front-end interactivity.
  - **styles.css**: CSS file for styling the web pages.
- **templates/**: Directory containing HTML templates.
  - **index.html**: Main HTML template for the web application.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/petrol-diesel-price-prediction.git
   cd petrol-diesel-price-prediction
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the application.

## Usage

- **Web Interface**: Interact with the model through the web interface. Enter the required details and get the predicted prices of petrol and diesel.
- **Model Training**: Use the `final model.ipynb` notebook to understand the data processing and model training steps.

## Dependencies

Make sure to have the following dependencies installed:
- Flask
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter
